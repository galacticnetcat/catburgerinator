Are you a Discord mod? Are you a Reddit mod? Do you run a forum? Are you safeguarding officer at an education facility? 

Well then this is your sign,
I understand that muting people and being an oppressive dictator on the internet and ruining kids I mean safeguarding kids can be really REALLY tough, that's why I made this MacOS exclusive that notifies you whenever McDonald's have a brand new buy one get one free deal.

Like you know how I always chase cheese burgers in my pfp sometimes and always talk about cheese burgers, well I just really cheese burgers and I wanted to make getting cheese burgers easier but then I realised I don't cheese burgers THAT MUCH nor do I like fast food that much, but I know for a fact Discord mods, Reddit mods, and safeguarding officers LOVE FAST FOOD, so yeah, it's a win win :D
Oh sorry it's only for Mac users, I hate Windows, if you use Windows please switch to Linux or Mac.
